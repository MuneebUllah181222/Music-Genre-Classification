# Music Genre Classification
 This is a mini project that I worked on during my internship at Technocolabs. The goal of this project was to classify music genres into two classes: hip-hop and rock. The project used two datasets, one in JSON format and one in CSV format.
 
 ## Tasks completed in this project
- Reading and analyzing the input files
- Normalizing and standardizing the data
- Visualizing the data
- Conducting principal component analysis
- Performing mathematical operations on the data
- Building a logistic regression model
- Building a decision tree model
- Comparing the performance of the decision tree and logistic regression models

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The following libraries were used in this project:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
To run the project, you will need to have these libraries installed on your system.

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:
``` Python
pip install pandas
pip install numpy 
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
```
# Usage
To run the project, simply run the music_genre_classification.py file using python:

``` python music_genre_classification.py ```

The output of the project will be displayed on the console.

## Conclusion
This project shows that it is possible to classify music genres using machine learning techniques. The decision tree model performed better than the logistic regression model in this case.
